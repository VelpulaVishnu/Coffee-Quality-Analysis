## Business Objective  
The Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) is a non-profit organization that promotes global coffee quality standards.  
This project supports CQI‚Äôs mission by:  
- Understanding key sensory and physical factors influencing cup quality.  
- Identifying countries and processing methods that yield higher-quality coffee.  
- Reducing defects to enhance supply quality and profitability.

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Data modeling, visualization, and DAX calculations  
- **Microsoft Excel** ‚Äì Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **Power Query Editor** ‚Äì Data transformation  
- **PowerPoint** ‚Äì Presentation and storytelling

## Data Preprocessing  
Performed entirely in **Excel and Power Query Editor**.  

Key steps:  
- **Column Standardization:** All column names converted to lowercase with underscores for consistency.  
- **Text Cleaning:** Trimmed spaces, removed special characters (e.g., ‚ÄúÂè∞ÁÅ£ÂíñÂï°Á†îÁ©∂ÂÆ§ ‚Üí Taiwan Coffee Laboratory‚Äù).  
- **Type Corrections:** Converted ID columns to text; standardized lot numbers and harvest years.  
- **Missing Values:** Replaced nulls with "Unknown" or "not_available".  
- **Altitude Fix:** Split altitude ranges (e.g., ‚Äú1200‚Äì1600‚Äù) and replaced outliers using median values.  
- **Bag Weight:** Removed "kg" text, replaced extreme values with standard weight (60kg).  
- **Processing Method & Variety:** Simplified naming (e.g., "Washed/Wet" ‚Üí "Washed").  
- **Total Cup Points:** Recomputed from sensory attributes for better accuracy.

## Data Modeling  
Built a **Star Schema** model in Power BI for structured analysis.  

**Fact Table:**  
- `fact_coffee` ‚Üí Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Clean Cup, Sweetness, Total Cup Points, Defects, etc.  

**Dimension Tables:**  
- `dim_country` ‚Äì Country and region data  
- `dim_processing_method` ‚Äì Coffee processing techniques  
- `dim_variety` ‚Äì Coffee bean varieties  
- `dim_color` ‚Äì Bean color attributes  
- `dim_partner` ‚Äì Partner or grading organizations  
- `dim_date` ‚Äì Based on grading date for trend analysis  

This model supports flexible slicing by country, process, variety, or partner for detailed insights.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Sensory Attributes**
- Analyzed 10 core attributes ‚Äî Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Clean Cup, Sweetness, and Overall.  
- Clean Cup, Sweetness, and Uniformity achieved perfect scores (10/10).  
- Aroma (7.72), Flavor (7.74), Aftertaste (7.60) slightly lag behind.  
- Higher altitudes correlated with scores above 85.  
- Best methods: **Double Anaerobic, Semi-Washed, and Honey (Mossto)**.
